# Image Edge Detection in Cloud Application Development

This README provides instructions on running the image edge detection code in a cloud application development environment. The code uses the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges in an image. The implementation relies on the OpenCV library for image processing.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 or later)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) (an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library)
- A cloud development environment (e.g., IBM Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)

## Installation

1. **Python**: If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **OpenCV**: You can install OpenCV using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Cloud Development Environment**: Ensure you have access to a cloud development environment. If you're using a specific cloud platform like IBM Cloud, make sure you have an account and the necessary tools installed.

## Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/gmpranav2004/pranav.gm2004
   cd image-edge-detection-cloud-app
   ```

2. **Upload Your Image**:

   Place the image you want to process in the project directory with the name `original.jpeg`.

4. **Run the Code**:

   Execute the Python script to perform edge detection on the image:

   ```bash
   python edge_detection.py
   ```

5. **View the Results**:

   The code will create an output image called `Canny Edge Detection.jpeg` in the project directory. You can download and view this image to see the edges detected in the original image.

## Customize Parameters

You can customize the parameters of the Canny edge detection algorithm by editing the `edge_detection.py` script. Adjust the thresholds and parameters according to your image's characteristics and requirements.

## Cloud Integration

If you intend to integrate this code into a cloud application, you can:

- Upload your image to cloud storage.
- Use cloud-based image processing services to execute the edge detection code.
- Retrieve and store the processed image in your cloud storage or database.
- Implement web services or APIs to trigger the image processing and retrieve the results.
